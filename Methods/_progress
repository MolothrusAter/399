Recognizer settings common to all recognizers (format):

Max Sample Delay
doesn't matter; only looking at single channel (has to do with delay b/w mics)

Sample Rate (Hz): 20000
training clip song freq has max 9000; sample rate higher than 18000 (twice the max freq) adds nothing and uses more cpu

FFT Size: 256
small FFT = more detail in time; large FFT = more detail in freq. Trillers better w/ smaller FFT size. Visualize w/ spectrogram plot

Freq. range (min, range): 47, 49
use log scale spectrogram view. adjust min. to bottom of target signal, then max to just above top of target signal. (bg noise is low-freq. biased)

Background Filter: 1s
maximum feature reduction without losing primary song features. see backgroundfilter_*.png (presentation media)

Dynamic Range (dB): 18
signal:noise ratio (dB) determined w/ visual inspection of normalized spectrogram

Resolution: ?
low resolution is suitable for "narrow band" (intensity range) feature vectors. also, low resolution may be necessary in low quality recordings w/ lots of bg noise. can be visualized in slice plot. (slice plot can view different time slices by holding shift and moving the mouse)

Max Song (ms): 3200
duration of the training clip

Max Syllable (ms): 180
duration of syllables in the training clip; visualized w/ signal detection waveform view

Max Syllable Gap (ms): 100
duration of syllables in the training clip; visualized w/ signal detection waveform view
