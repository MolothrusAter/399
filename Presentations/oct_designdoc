Intro

Background/Objectives
objectives:
	build an idealized recognizer
	determine primary factors to consider in optimizing a non-ideal recognizer
	compare detection rates between human observers and recognizers

Methods
Recognizers built with different levels of training on a single recording
	the training clip was a 12m playback at 80dB in coniferous forest, chosen by high signal to noise ratio (clear signal, little bg noise)


Results (so far)

What's next
Look at how a "perfect" recognizer compares with humans
